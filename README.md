# Standardised Bloomberg Fixed Income Data Processing
This project was started as a academic project I did for my fixed income securitiy module at Singapore Management University.
The original data was simplied and less complete. For this project I used the excel files generated by export function in Bloomberg. I manaully merged them into one but feel free to use different xlsx files.

Data Input: (data 3.11.xlsx)
The data date is 11th of March 2019. Given that the current day date is constantly updated every few minutes. I used the close rates so they are constant and more respresentative.

This notebook doesn't take processing date adjustments into account. (i.e. when you buy an IRS today, the effective date will actually be a few days later)

For OIS (Overnight Interest Rate Swaps):
6 columns with a range of data dates. 10 Years maximum.

For IRS: (Interest Rate Swaps)

The time steps for first 2 years are 3 months. We stick to this frequency and boostrap a discount factor curve of 4*50 data points, up to 50 years.
Note the maximum window for IRS(50) and IR Swaps(30*30=60) are different, for our Swaption pricing we do up to 30*20.

IR Swaptions(Volatility): (Interest Rate Swaptions)

These vol data are of Black vol (market standard and primary in Bloomberg).
We use the swaption data to calibrate our SABR parameters.
